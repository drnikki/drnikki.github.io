      <description>My research agenda examines how software engineering practices are situated within contemporary political and social systems of power.

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired of feeling terrible, and super tired of feeling like the country is in a new level of shit, when - let&amp;rsquo;s be honest - it&amp;rsquo;s been shit for everyone but white men since the beginning.</description>

      <description>This is just a quick overview post on what&amp;rsquo;s happening with Drupal.org (owned by the Drupal Association) collecting demographic information on it&amp;rsquo;s members. The current proposal is that the user profile form will have fields at least for gender and &amp;ldquo;ideally&amp;rdquo; for other demographic categories (race, sexual orientation, etc)</description>

      <description>This summer I wrote my second year project. As I gathered items, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to list them all as &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; since I did a lot of skimming and extracting rather than wholesale reading.</description>

The bibliography that follows is a first iteration of works that I’m gathering to explore epistemological and structural parallels between distributed ledger technology (aka blockchain) and whisper networks (as defined as “An informal chain of conversations among members of an oppressed or marginalized group about oppressors who need to be watched because of predatory behavior” expanded from definition here).</description>

      <description>I spent July thinking about open source community health:
how do measures of open source project success interact with measures of community health? (they don&amp;rsquo;t, because no measures of community health exist) what would a &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; open source community look like?</description>

      <description>I have often thought, &amp;ldquo;I wish I knew what people in [insert name of PhD program] were reading.&amp;rdquo; because I wanted to do that same reading. Some courses had syllabi available, some had notes, but it was hard to get a sense of the themes that were being discussed.</description>

      <description>Nick and I met at Drupalcon New Orleans to discuss doing a survey to get some data about the diversity within the community of people who make the internet. Many such surveys have been done (here two: Slack and New Relic) but we wanted approach everything differently.</description>

      <description>At Drupalcon New Orleans, I held a BOF entitled “Keeping it Exciting After All these Years.” It was a small group - seven people, including myself. We discussed some the ways that we find technology work to have transformed from genuine enthusiasm resembling “I can’t believe people pay me to do this!</description>

      <description>Making bad hiring choices I&amp;rsquo;ve been actively interviewing and part of the hiring process for engineers, project managers and product owners for the last 8 years. In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably hired about 30 people (fewer if you exclude long-term contractors) to work with me directly, and been a voice at the table for the hiring of about another 20 people.</description>

      <description>Several times in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve entered companies with the opportunity to &amp;ldquo;build my own team.&amp;rdquo; For whatever reason (and that reason will become important later), the company had been outsourcing all of their web development to an (often offshore) agency.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite things about being a programmer is that I can figure out ways to solve little problems. Little non-problems, even. Over the last week, there have been Time Warner internet outages in my neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Setting Language manually in Django 1.4</title>
      <link>https://nikkistevens.com/posts/setting-language-manually-in-django-1-dot-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent today debugging a multilingual django app that I didn&amp;rsquo;t write.  The problem is that the site&amp;rsquo;s language was being changed when you used the language switcher, but not if you typed in the url.  So &lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/fr&#34;&gt;http://example.com/fr&lt;/a&gt; would only &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; land you on the French version of the site. When you&amp;rsquo;re using custom language codes for any reason (in our case, we were matching the client&amp;rsquo;s lang codes) you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to set the app&amp;rsquo;s language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>(October 12, 2017) What follows is my thesis from the University of Hawai`i. It&amp;rsquo;s included here for anyone interested in grassroots activist organizing and its impact on the participants.
Reading this over, it feels like I wrote it 20 years and 100 books ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful that my opinions and insight have evolved (for better or worse) since I wrote this.</description>
