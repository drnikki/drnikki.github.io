[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m so excited to give a talk at MIT on Tuesday. I\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about reverse engineering. If I need to sound fancy about it, I will tell you that \u0026ldquo;reverse engineering is a logic and approach that is core to my method.\u0026rdquo; Put more plainly, I use reverse engineering and other \u0026ldquo;take it apart and figure out how it works\u0026rdquo; approaches to academic software research. Details (and poster!) below.\nSoftware from the Inside Out: Reverse Engineering as Method\nNikki Stevens, PhD\nTuesday, Sept 24 12:00-1:15pm EST\nIn person: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, DUSP: Building 9, Room 451 on zoom: 💻 https://mit.zoom.us/j/96238770940\nAbstract\nHow would our studies of software change if we could examine the code itself? What new forms of inquiry become available when we reduce the opacity of commercial software products? In this talk, I describe several processes of reverse engineering, a series of methods by which we can look inside software that we did not build. Throughout, I discuss opportunities for inquiry and theorization offered by penetration approaches, as well as some common ethical and legal considerations. I ground the theory with case studies from Android applications, Internet of Things products, and the US criminal legal system. Ultimately, I argue that reverse engineering is a key method for the humanistic and social studies of software and will have implications for scholars and practitioners interested in software\u0026rsquo;s role in social change. Bio\nNikki Stevens is a critical technology researcher, software practitioner, and open-source community leader. Their research demonstrates that data infrastructures—data models, databases, data structures—are locations in which software harms can be incubated, exacerbated, or ameliorated. Using mixed methods, including historical analysis, reverse engineering and speculative design, Stevens excavates technical practices, linking them to aspects of contemporary structural oppression. Their first monograph, Abolitionist Engineering (in progress), develops an approach to data structures that orients engineering practice towards alternative futures. In industry, Stevens led the architecture of software products for billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola, Sony, and Instagram, and their work has won numerous awards, including at SXSW, the premier conference for new media. In open source, Stevens’ work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award and recognitions by Red Hat and The Linux Foundation. Their work has been supported by Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft. They are currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT\u0026rsquo;s Data + Feminism Lab.\n(Downloadable Poster) 📄 Downloadable Poster\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/2024-09-20-mit-talk/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m so excited to give a talk at MIT on Tuesday.

At parties, I tell people that I study software, people, and infrastructure and how those three combine in messy, violent, generative, and always complicated ways. My main focus right now is writing a book (!!): while we might frequently hear accusations of tech being racist or transphobic (or just generally contributing to injustice), we don\u0026rsquo;t often see the technical causes of those outcomes; my research uncovers those causes \u0026ndash; when we know how we are making [bad thing], then we may have an opportunity to do things differently.

In this work, I ask questions like: (these questions are what I\u0026rsquo;m writing my book about)\nHow can software engineers support social justice causes in their technical practices? How have the ways we make software been shaped by oppressive social forces? What new technical practices can we (engineers) integrate into our pipelines? How do the ways that we collect data about people shape the experiences of those people? This is pretty abstract, but if you invite me for a talk (hint hint), I would give talks titled:\n\u0026ldquo;Abolitionist Data Practices: Applying political goals to data structures\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Is my database racist? How white supremacy structures our databases\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The history of data modeling\u0026rdquo; (this one is more exciting than it sounds, I swear!) \u0026ldquo;Beyond \u0026lsquo;anti-racist\u0026rsquo; engineering: why anti-racism does not make better software\u0026rdquo; A note about methods In order to unearth tehnical roots of injustice, I use several approaches, which I broadly consider to be three kinds of engineering:\nFrequently, I perform what I call historical engineering: I use close reading, archival analysis, and software design to excavate software engineering practices with the aim of historicizing and denaturalizing them. Using this method, I have reviewed texts from early data modelers, like E.F. Codd and Peter P.Y. Chen. I also recreate technology and practices identified in early patent documents to identify the moments in which problematic epistemologies were codified.*\nI very often use reverse engineering to hack into existing software applications and examine the choices made by their creators. Most often, I reverse engineer the Android applications of smart home devices to uncover the relational data models within. I analyze in-code annotations, create entity-relationship diagrams, and then examine those resultant models, again linking them back to systems of race and gender power. In my work, I have developed a method for performing a reverse engineering investigations within a specific sociotechnical context \u0026ndash; a situated analysis of the contextual epistemological frames embedded within relational paradigms.\nI also use speculative engineering and software engineering to explore the potentiality and creative possibilities of existing and not-yet-created computational tools. In my speculative engineering process, I frequently suggest that the temporality of modern digital computing is incommensurate with the temporality of modern transgender lives. Following this, I design and build a trans-inclusive data model that demonstrates ways to actively subvert systems of racialized and gendered power.\nThe most well-developed example of these methods in practice is in my dissertation, Modeling Power: Data Models and the Production of Social Inequality.\nYou can also read my other work (PDFs linked below):\nStevens, Nikki L., Anna Lauren Hoffman, Sarah Florini. “The Unremarked Optimum: Whiteness, Optimization, and Control in The Database Revolution.” Review of Communication.

December 2018\nA note about community and context My work with software and thinking about it\u0026rsquo;s harms is greatly influenced by my time in open source software communities, and all of the collaborators with whom I have worked to make change. In the Drupal community, I founded the Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Working Group. With a few others, we grew the group from 5 to 700 over two years, and grappled with ways to make Drupal a safer space for folks from underrepresented groups.\nOut of this work came Open Demographics, a project that uses open source paradigmns to construct demographic questions, following the disability justice paradigm \u0026ldquo;Nothing About Us Without Us.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve consulted for Mozilla, Stack Overflow, WordPress on asking demographic questions and then, doing the even tougher work of figuring out what comes next.\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/research/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy research agenda examines how software engineering practices are situated within contemporary political and social systems of power.

It uses an open source paradigm (community sourced, publicly accessible) to generate a collective consensus on the most inclusive ways to ask questions. This project is not without it\u0026rsquo;s own political shortcomings and challenges - it\u0026rsquo;s in English, and most contributors are based in the United States.

I am continually reminded of how little I know about making communities better in slow, steady practice. In contrast to the theory of my PhD, and the radical protest of my younger days, my current work is more complicated, more intricate, and far slower than I was prepared for.

Some courses had syllabi available, some had notes, but it was hard to get a sense of the themes that were being discussed. I told myself that if I were ever lucky enough to be able enter a PhD program, I’d share as much as I could about the material I was reading.

Speakers cited specifically where they learned a concept (\u0026ldquo;from an elder in Treaty 3\u0026rdquo;), why they used a particular framework (because it was used \u0026ldquo;by an elder who I\u0026rsquo;m accountable to\u0026rdquo;), and made a point to acknowledge the roles of other people in all of their work.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"On developing a practice of acknowledgment"},{"content":"Hi. In a way, everything feels terrible right now, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? I\u0026rsquo;m pretty tired of feeling terrible, and super tired of feeling like the country is in a new level of shit, when - let\u0026rsquo;s be honest - it\u0026rsquo;s been shit for everyone but white men since the beginning. I hear a lot of people feeling powerless; folks are tired. Me too, y\u0026rsquo;all (and #metoo).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what everyone is capable of, though I believe it to be more than we even realize, but I have figured out what I can do right now. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a programmer for a long time, and part of open source software communities for many years. This combination means that when I figure something out I make a list and I write a blog. So\u0026hellip; in line with my devotion to open source knowledge, open communication, transparent processes, and public commitments, here I am publicly committing to what I can do 100% of the time* in the next 12 months. I\u0026rsquo;m going to vote, obviously. But beyond that, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked myself: What does it look like to make a conscious, sustainable effort to invest in the future I want?\nThe big key for me is sustainable: I have a job; I\u0026rsquo;m in graduate school doing work that I believe will make me a more effective change agent when it\u0026rsquo;s done; I\u0026rsquo;m involved with several dysfunctional communities that need my support. What can I commit to doing constantly and consistently in light of my other obligations? A lot of the commitments below are things that folks already say they do all the time - but if they did them all the time, I think the world would look pretty different. My trust for white folks (and white women specifically) is at an all-time low, so despite some of these feeling like really base-level behavior, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to be explicit and to specify exactly how I\u0026rsquo;m going to honor and fulfill my commitments. These public commitments also mean that if you see me breaking them, I invite you to call me out on it.\ntl;dr: I commit to put money in the pockets of people of color and put emotional energy into dealing with my racist and sexist white sisters.\nI have economic commitments The absolutely easiest way I can act in line with my values is by paying attention to where and how I spend money. Simply not spending money at companies that do violence to communities of color is a no-brainer. It\u0026rsquo;s also different from actively trying to put my money into the pockets of people of color in my community.\nI increased my donations to Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU If I drank alcohol, I would avoid Constellation brands in solidarity with those fighting for water rights. Read more at Latino Rebels and NPR. When I\u0026rsquo;m choosing a service, I commit to specifically searching first for businesses that are black or POC owned. Anything you need, you can find from a business owned by a POC. I don\u0026rsquo;t spend a ton of money on things (see above re: grad school), but when I do, I do it specifically from black-owned businesses. When I get my head shaved, I go to a local black-owned barbershop. When I\u0026rsquo;m shopping on Etsy, I start with their listing of black owned shops There may be a black-owned farm or grocery store in your area, but there\u0026rsquo;s not one here that I\u0026rsquo;ve found yet. This is a great black-owned crystal shop If you have a regular service provider who is white, can you change so that you\u0026rsquo;re putting money into POC pockets? I\u0026rsquo;m actively looking for a POC sports massage therapist in my area. I\u0026rsquo;m still struggling with how to spend less money on Amazon - I need to buy books, and I need to get them used and not spend a ton of time tracking them down - but I\u0026rsquo;m working on it.\nI have academic commitments Last year, I sat in a master class with a well-known (white, cismale) scholar and listened to him denigrate United States slaves. None of us said anything because we were scared of our department chair and the scholar. I haven\u0026rsquo;t repeated that silence, and here I renew my commitment to calling out racist, sexist, colonialist, transphobic and other bullshit every time I see it in a classroom, regardless of the power dynamics at play. I #citeblackwomen and, wherever possible, read womxn, trans* folks, people of color, indigenous, and disabled scholars. I commit to recommending only work by people who do not identify as cisgendered white men. I commit to collaborating only with scholars whose politics and ethics I respect and whose values are anti-racist, anti-transphobic, anti-Islamophobic, anti\u0026hellip;.. If I find out that I\u0026rsquo;m working with a scholar who does not share these views, I commit to terminating that working relationship (but helping them wake the fuck up, if they are white women; see the next section). As a graduate student, my attention and labor are the only currencies I have to spend - I commit to spending them with scholars who are working to make the world better. I have social commitments Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets really exhausting, but I\u0026rsquo;m doing it anyway: I commit to talking with all of the white women in my life whose actions support patriarchy. This is my least favorite thing to do and the thing that I think is the most important here. These conversations mean that I often need to ignore cisnormative/transviolent dialogue to help folks ease into thinking critically about patriarchy. I commit to that ignoring in the service of bringing folks along.\nI also:\ncommit to being visible and vocal in my communities to advocate for victims of abuse and harassment. Tactically, this means that I commit to responding publicly when an issue occurs and making it uncomfortable for white women to perpetuate patriarchal and racist violence. This means that I\u0026rsquo;m willing to be that person who won\u0026rsquo;t shut up about an issue that continues to make communities dangerous. commit to supporting others doing good work and getting into good trouble in any way that I can. commit to addressing 100% of the racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, *ist comments that I hear I would like this to mean calling in whenever possible. commit to holding space for folks to come together and process what\u0026rsquo;s happening I would like this to include support in meaningful ways - time, food, physical space commit to volunteering in my community at least once a month, with organizations that work towards racial and economic justice. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that courts will save us, and I know that putting my body and energy towards people who need it is valuable. I have limits Lest it seem like I\u0026rsquo;m here all \u0026ldquo;look at me do all the things,\u0026rdquo; here are some things I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this year because I know I can\u0026rsquo;t engage with them sustainably or in a way that\u0026rsquo;s safe for me.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t:\nspend time or emotional labor educating white cisgendered men. (Get on it, other men) spend time caring for and curating safe online spaces. read material from the \u0026ldquo;other side.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll be passing on works by Jonathan Haidt, thanks. make time commitments to recruit voters or to campaign for candidates. commit to actively interrogate the politics of people in designated \u0026ldquo;no politics\u0026rdquo; zones. My gym, for example, is a wild mix of political views (including folks who are alllll the way right) and they try to leave it all at the door, so I\u0026rsquo;m respecting that. I will, however, continue to not tolerate any racist bullshit from other white people. Will this change the world? Nope. But this will change how I feel about what I can do tomorrow. It will keep me accountable for actively doing my part to dismantle oppressive systems. I hope that it encourages others to make public, time-based and specific (aka SMART goals) commitments to what they can do. Most importantly, this gives me a framework to move forward and know that I\u0026rsquo;m making small differences while I figure out where I can make big difference. Have questions, white women? Let\u0026rsquo;s talk.\n\\* The 100% of the time is really important here. In recovery circles, folks talk about the exception reinforcing the need for commitment. \"I'm going to have one drink on Thanksgiving because I can't handle my family\" reinforces the assertion that maybe the speaker needs to commit to abstinence. \"I'm going to fight racism _except_ this one time with my boss\" reinforces white supremacy and the speaker's alliance with oppressors.

During the spring semester, I\u0026rsquo;m reading for my comprehensive exams and so already know what I\u0026rsquo;ll be reading for the next few months. I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on three areas: software engineering ethics, intersectional STS (science and technology studies), and the social history of computing. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve read all of these, I\u0026rsquo;ll write a long paper (about 8,000 words, or ~16 single-spaced pages) about what I\u0026rsquo;ve read. Then, I\u0026rsquo;ll sit for an oral exam with my committee. Then, I\u0026rsquo;m done! (Nothing left to do but a quick little dissertation.)\nThis is a long list, in alphabetical order.

I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on three areas: software engineering ethics, intersectional STS (science and technology studies), and the social history of computing.  Once I\u0026rsquo;ve read all of these, I\u0026rsquo;ll write a long paper (about 8,000 words, or ~16 single-spaced pages) about what I\u0026rsquo;ve read.

The current proposal is that the user profile form will have fields at least for gender and \u0026ldquo;ideally\u0026rdquo; for other demographic categories (race, sexual orientation, etc)\nAn incomplete history around 2010, there was an issue to expand Drupal\u0026rsquo;s gender field, which at the time had options for only male or female. This issue is long (154 comments) and notoriously full of vitriol and some of the best and worst of the Drupal community. The resolution was to lock the thread and leave the field as is.\nThat issue spawned (or was filed in parallel) with another issue to include pronouns on a user\u0026rsquo;s profile. In November 2011, the drupal.org gender field had the following options: male, female, transgender, other.\nThere was a related issue for adding an \u0026ldquo;about me\u0026rdquo; field to the profile. If you\u0026rsquo;re going through the comments of these issues, you\u0026rsquo;ll see some familiar names in all threads - some still active and known for their social justice work, and other still active and known for their active misogyny.\nother things have happened here in the middle (still looking to fill this in - I was not active in the community for a few years)\naround Feb 2017, there was an issue filed to Improve / \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the gender field.\nIn May 2017, I created Open Demographics - an open source project designed to crowd source the demographic fields.\nIn cooperation with the Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Contrib Team (disclosure: I founded DD\u0026amp;I, but Tara King and others have lead this initiative) took over Jesse Beachgender module and have been working to make it compatible with Open Demographics.\nOn May 9, Dries (the founder of Drupal) wrote a blog post announcing that Drupal.org was going to use the Open Demographics project to power the demographic portion of the user profile fields on Drupal.org.\nCurrent Status There is an open issue for this integration\nThere are conversations about why this data is necessary and what will be done with it (including how it will be stored, who will have access) when it is collected.\nThe gender field has been removed from drupal.org\nA pronoun field has been added\nOther Information (mostly for my reference)\nSage Sharp\u0026rsquo;s tweets on why D.o needs to collect gender as a barrier to registration (this was before the field was removed)\nGeek feminism wiki\u0026rsquo;s recap of the above\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/drupal-open-demographics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is just a quick overview post on what\u0026rsquo;s happening with Drupal.org (owned by the Drupal Association) collecting demographic information on it\u0026rsquo;s members.

I\u0026rsquo;m trying not to get interested in anything new (which is hard, because there\u0026rsquo;s so many good and interesting things!), but instead to produce something from all of my questioning last semester.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Open Source PhD: January 2018"},{"content":"i write code in public\u0026hellip; Over the semester break, I cleaned up my filing system and archived all of the writing that I did last semester - approximately 30,000 words. As I was putting it away, and sometimes even as I was writing it, I thought - what a shame that I can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else with all of this work\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve thought often about the disconnect between the way that I write code and the way that I write (non-code) words. When I start a technical project, the first thing I do is create a public repository and I begin making a mess of it, as publicly as possible. For a while, I was shy about the starts and stops and mistakes, visible in commit messages like adding mongoDB followed immediately by removing mongoDB wtf have i done. Over time, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized a few important things about this process of public software making:\nwe all work in meandering and experimental ways public meandering helps to normalize the process I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in selling anyone (especially myself) visions of a smooth and error-free creation process, especially with something as intricate as software. \u0026hellip; so why not words? I was struggling to link this public software process to creating a public academic writing process until I stumbled across this quote by Michelle Moravec:\nAcademic writing practices mystify the labor writing takes. The commodification of ideas as currency in academia means that writing is often concealed until publication, leaving the interim versions in the struggle towards a publishable version unseen. (source).\nWhat I love so much about open source is that it totally demystifies the process of how something is created. If someone has the time, they can go back through every bump in the road, every wtf commit message, and every issue to see the evolution of a project. I recently got to read a pre-release copy of a faculty member\u0026rsquo;s book. It felt a bit like looking behind the curtain, and when I saw mistakes, and omissions and evidence of copying and pasting I was delighted. It helped to demystify, a little, the process of creating such a large and impressive text.\nretroactive exposure I wrote for two classes last semester, and I made a folder for each of them in a public repository. Where possible, I put in a graded copy of the assignment - the professor\u0026rsquo;s work is part of the process, and showing my work as though it were all well-received would be false, and might contribute to the idea that this experience is not full of shortcomings and attempts that are not quite right, whatever the reason.\nreal-time exposure Putting in work that\u0026rsquo;s already done and graded and which I already feel disconnected from was one thing. It\u0026rsquo;s entirely another to share work that I\u0026rsquo;m about to submit or (even more vulnerably) that I\u0026rsquo;m still figuring out. But that\u0026rsquo;s the point of it all. So in addition to adding a folder for the class I\u0026rsquo;m in this semester (a second seminar about the foundations of STS), I\u0026rsquo;ve also added a section for works in progress and things that will get made this semester. I\u0026rsquo;m committing to publicly share this as I work on it and as I make more commits like wtf why is this so hard.\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/writing-in-the-open/","summary":"\u003ch4 id=\"i-write-code-in-public\"\u003ei write code in public\u0026hellip;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the semester break, I cleaned up my filing system and archived all of the writing that I did last semester - approximately 30,000 words.

I mean, I made many mistakes, but two are relevant here:\nI did not do a good job of tracking what I read. This meant that I when I would try to find Smart Thing\u0026nbsp;so that I could use it, and I couldn't remember where I'd read it. I spent a lot of time retracing my steps from source A to source B to find things. I did not do a good job of taking notes on what I read. This meant that when I finally found that Smart Thing that Scholar had said, I couldn't remember how I wanted to use it or what place I'd found for it in my work.\u0026nbsp; So to avoid mistake #1, I'm using\u0026nbsp;Zotero to store items, generate bibliographies, and to insert citations into documents (all the standard stuff ). I followed fairly closely an updated version of the Zotero + Zotfile + Zotpad workflow described here. I can say that I am doing a good job of keeping track of everything\u0026nbsp;that I've been reading and Zotero makes it simple for me to do a full-text search of my entire library to relocate a specific Smart Thing that I read once.\nWhen I started taking notes on things that I was reading (to avoid mistake #2), I stored those notes along with the item itself in Zotero. Sometimes they were just notes, but most often I would write up a formal, public-facing annotation that I could share with other students or professors. I assumed (incorrectly) that since Zotero is powered by an SQL database, surely there would be an easy way for me to generate an annotated bibliography with my own annotations instead of the items' abstracts.\nI couldn't find an easy way; so, I wrote one. This script\u0026nbsp;will go through your entire Zotero account\u0026nbsp;and search for items\u0026nbsp;that match a certain criteria.\u0026nbsp; It will then go and get any annotations for that item (and it knows how to distinguish a formal \"annotation\" note from just a \"i hope no one sees this private jumbling of thoughts\" note).\u0026nbsp; It will then print out the citation (in whatever format you wish) and then the annotation.\u0026nbsp; And magic!\u0026nbsp; An annotated bibliography\u0026nbsp;that's perfect for comps or for when someone just casually asks you to send them all your notes on a topic.\nWhat's not magic is that in order to use this script, you'll need to be comfortable editing a Python file\u0026nbsp;and running it in your terminal. I wish I had a more universally accessible offering, but I'm hopeful that by sharing this, folks will contribute to it and that over time it will become something that can be used by the majority of people who, let's face it, do not want to run Python just to generate a bibliography.\nTake a look at the script itself and then read these instructions to get started.\u0026nbsp;If you have any suggestions for improvement (there are still a few bugs, too) feel free to comment here or\u0026nbsp;open an issue\u0026nbsp;on\u0026nbsp;GitHub\u0026nbsp;if you feel comfortable doing so.\u0026nbsp;\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/zotero-annotated-bibliography/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e(this was \u003ca href=\"https://www.hastac.org/blogs/nikkistevens/2018/01/04/generate-annotated-bibliography-zotero\"\u003eoriginally posted\u003c/a\u003e on the HASTAC website as part of my HASTAC 17-19 Scholars participation.)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started a PhD program this semester, and I vowed not to repeat some of the mistakes of my master's thesis.

However, Pielke only discusses science. What, then, of technology in his framework?\nAmong it’s many uses, science can discover the natural laws/reality of the world we live in. We embed our values into scientific practice and policy and our values certainly become apparent when we choose where to invest money; but sometimes the outcome of scientific research - like the “discovery” of gravity - simply is. Gravity itself is value-neutral.\nI believe that there is no value-neutral technological equivalent. All technology, and indeed everything that we make, is value embedded. Does this inherent difference mean that Pielke’s work is only for science and not “science and technology”?\nLet’s look at his useful thought experiment of Tornado and Abortion politics. In Pielke’s construction, we need Tornado politics as a contrast to Abortion politics. Finding a technology equivalent of Abortion politics is not hard to do. A good candidate is the use of criminal justice algorithms. These algorithms are often used to determine length of sentencing, whether to release an inmate on parole, or bail amounts. There are different types of algorithms, but their function is to estimate the likelihood that an individual will be a repeat offender.\nMapping this to Pielke’s chart, the algorithms are used to rationalize punishment, justify racist/biased decisions, are applied selectively, are part of an emotional narrative and are a means of maintaining power (43). A perfect fit.\nTo what can we contrast that in technology? Tornado politics requires values consensus and low uncertainty. What technology exists that has values consensus? In the case of the tornado, the role of science is to help people determine facts about a scientific phenomenon - in this case, a weather event. There is no contest about the inherent goodness or evil of the tornado itself. As Pielke states, in Tornado Politics “once everyone obtains a shared level of understanding a preferred course of action will become obvious and non-controversial” (42). This is simply not possible when making decisions about/with technology.\nIf the thought experiment does not map, do the corresponding roles? Yes and no.\nThe “Pure Technologist” embodies nearly everything that’s wrong with technology today - focusing only on what technology is capable of and not at all on its uses or impacts.\nThe “Technology Issue Advocate” is certainly evident when you examine debates about AI or surveillance technology. It’s trickier because one cannot be an expert in technology the way that one can be an expert in a discipline of science.\nThe “Technology Arbiter” focuses on issues that can be resolved by technology. This seems straightforward enough, but technologists do a very poor job of anticipating the impacts of their technologies. Thus, problems involving technological solutions don’t meet some of Pielke’s criteria for simple decisions - the problems are not bounded, and there is infinite ambiguity in the number of choices (24).\nI also have my doubts about the “Honest Broker of Technology Policy Alternatives.” Because so much technology is ambiguous and open to interpretation, even the title “Honest Broker” is inappropriate.\nGiven that the roles above don’t map perfectly to the technology imaginary, how can we envision the roles of technologists in making policy decisions?\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/honest-broker/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSharing some thoughts about Robert Pielke\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Honest-Broker-Making-Science-Politics/dp/0521694817\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Honest Broker\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and whether it\u0026rsquo;s applicable to technology contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, when we talk about science and technology, we talk about them as one field: “science and technology.”  We acknowledge the imaginaries of both and then combine them into an even more monolithic imaginary of S\u0026amp;T.

Many such surveys have been done (here two: Slack and New Relic) but we wanted approach everything differently. Both of us have a long history of open source involvement and deeply believe in open-source philosophies. We wanted to do a survey completely in the open, and completely transparently. We have been guided by the philosophy of “Nothing about us, without us.”\nFollowing that logic, we wanted to draft the survey with the community, making all decisions about its structure and content in public, and then open source the data we obtain and any insights we can extract. We started a repo and began work on the project in June.\nThe problem(s) with other diversity surveys It’s frustrating to complete a survey and then wait, and have the numbers crunched by people who I don’t know, delivering results that may or may not be, really, accurate to the data. Their interpretations may or may not be ‘correct’ and may be biased in any number of ways, but there’s no way to confirm that because the raw data was never shared.\nThis project gets around that by saying - everything is public from the start. We’re writing the survey questions in public, we’re going to be making the raw data public, and when conclusions are drawn, those will be done in public as well.\nI jumped in and expected (naively, I realize in retrospect) that everyone I spoke to about this would be just as excited.\nChallenge #1: Involvement I gave a talk at DCNOLA about diversity in Drupal, and followed that up with a well-attended BOF to brainstorm strategies we can implement surrounding diversity in our communities (both the Big Drupal community, and our smaller individual communities). The main take away, the majority of feedback I received was “let’s just please continue the conversation. This is an important conversation”.\nSo, since DCNOLA, I’ve hosted a diversity and inclusion chat in IRC and Slack (meeting notes and schedule). These have been adequately attended, but not to the level of interest that existed at Drupalcon. It’s possible, and likely, that attending these is not a value-add for a lot of people, and it’s difficult to take time away from paying work to have these conversations (part of the problem with recruitment and retention in open source communities to begin with). Getting the voices of a diverse group of people talking about the survey is an additional constraint on the project.\nBut the question remains: If people think this is so important, why are we having such problems getting people involved? How can we make participation meaningful and worth people taking time away from their jobs, children, partners, hobbies, etc.\nPart of the idea of “nothing about us without us” is that if there were a survey addressing dimensions of identity in technology workers, technology workers would be active participants in creating that survey. I want to make sure that people’s voices are heard when the determination about what diversity indicators/measures/metrics are being used. Left to my/our own devices, surely something is going to be overlooked.\nChallenge #2: The MVP of Identity If you asked 100 people what parts of them make them unique, or different from others, you’d certainly get 100 different answers, but there would be overlaps in those sets. The big 8 is an attempt to codify the main categories/buckets of identities that people use to self-identify.\nHowever, they are incomplete. For some people, religion is a huge part of their identity; for others, being nuero a-typical might be very important; for others, it might be their family’s working class socio-economic status.\nSo, we’re using the Big 8 as a starting place, but it’s here again that we need help from a wide variety of voices to make sure that we’re capturing as inclusive as possible a set of characteristics.\nAnother factor to consider is whether or not seeing questions about dimensions of identity with which people do not resonate would be a barrier to completing a quiz. How can we capture the minimum viable identity dimensions (and this would include the smallest data set that would also be useful for data analysis) without excluding people?\nChallenge #3: Measuring for Inclusion However, while we can measure for diversity (perfectly or imperfectly), it’s much more difficult to quantitatively measure for equality and inclusivity. A workplace can be diverse by the numbers, but still feel exclusionary and hostile to those not in the minority.\nHow can we get data about whether or not people outside of the majority identity dimensions feel welcomed in their workplaces? How can we measure whether or not they feel as though they’re being equitably compensated for their work and effort?\nOne could conclude that greater diversity will naturally begin to create a culture of inclusivity and equality, but studies have shown that this is not necessarily the case.\nTakeaways Going through this, we’ve learned (no surprise) that working on diversity and inclusion issues involves working through these and other challenges. We’re not sure what outcomes we’ll drive or change we’ll effect through this survey, but we each believe this topic is important to us, the teams we work on, and the communities we are a part of. Our aim is to increase awareness via both the survey itself, and the open source results. Stay tuned, and keep the discussion going with us at @nstielau and @drnikki.\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/2016-08-03-diversity-survey/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNick and I met at \u003ca href=\"https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016\"\u003eDrupalcon New Orleans\u003c/a\u003e to discuss doing a survey to get some data about the diversity within the community of people who make the internet.

We encounter this mentality with relationships - “keeping the passion alive” after being together with someone after N years - and our relationship with technology work is a relationship just the same. But does it need to be subjected to the same level of low expectations and burnout that some of us burden our romantic relationships with? Perhaps an extended relationship with programming can be cherished and thought of the same way we treat our cherished friends. Or, perhaps, after many years, it is a relationship that should be abandoned in favor of greener pastures.\nMotivation can come from being mindful in the rituals of programming, and in the moments, rather than in the search for meaningful projects or work for ‘meaningful’ clients.\nDoing work on a project that is personally meaningful to you - for a political or environmental cause, for example - is amazing, but access to those opportunities is limited and, even if obtained, may not be financially feasible.\nUpdate from 2022: In retrospect, it is no surprise that after this, I applied to graduate school - a choice that would eventually lead to a PhD and the transformation of my technical career.\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/finding-meaning/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt Drupalcon New Orleans, I held a BOF entitled “Keeping it Exciting After All these Years.”  It was a small group - seven people, including myself.

In that time, I\u0026rsquo;ve probably hired about 30 people (fewer if you exclude long-term contractors) to work with me directly, and been a voice at the table for the hiring of about another 20 people.

I think the first mistake we made was not identifying the roles that people were in the room to play. In a room of engineers interviewing another engineer, of course we\u0026rsquo;re all there to vet the candidate\u0026rsquo;s technical ability. But, we\u0026rsquo;re also all different, with different abilities and different qualities we look for in a candidate. In that sense, we\u0026rsquo;re all also there to decide, individually, \u0026ldquo;Is this person someone I want to work with?\u0026rdquo;\nThe ways that people come to a yes or no answer to that question are varied, and I can only speak for the ways in which I come to that answer. But what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that when someone says \u0026ldquo;No, something feels off,\u0026rdquo; we need to listen to that and honor that. If we\u0026rsquo;re going to overrule a person\u0026rsquo;s opinion on a person, they probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in the room to begin with, or their role needs to be more clearly defined.\nWhy did people say no? In nearly every case when things didn\u0026rsquo;t work out (but I was part of the choice to hire them anyway), the person who didn\u0026rsquo;t want them there could only articulate similar to \u0026ldquo;something just feels off.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a slippery slope when trying to honor people\u0026rsquo;s perceptions and intuitions and also help them see through any unconscious bias they might be having against the interview candidate. This comes back to trusting that the interviewers in the room are the right people and that you as the hiring manager can trust them to give informed and thoughtful opinions. I\u0026rsquo;ve made the mistake of saying \u0026ldquo;Can you give me something more than \u0026lsquo;something feels off\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;, watched them stumble, and then dismissed their hunch and pulled the hiring trigger.

During morning standups, there would be the three of us and a few male stakeholders - the VP of Product, a project manager, maybe the VP of Growth. But everyone on the call was male.\nAs I was addressing these groups, I heard myself saying \u0026ldquo;guys\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;Thanks, guys\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;Good morning, guys\u0026rdquo; - and I gave myself a pass because it was actually a group of guys. I specifically thought to myself \u0026ldquo;This is an appropriate thing to say because they are, in fact, all individuals who describe themlselves as male.\u0026rdquo; In retrospect, the fact that I heard myself say it and then rationalized its use should have been fair warning that it\u0026rsquo;s not behavior I want to model. In retrospect.\nOne day, Savino said to me, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you should stop using \u0026lsquo;guys\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo;\n\"I thought about that,\" I said and immediately thought-but-did-not-say \"See, I'm smart and I'm the boss and I think of everything!\" Defensiveness is another great warning sign, by the way.\n\"Right, but if you can say it, why can't I?\"\nThere are really two lessons here: one, always hire people who will tell you when you\u0026rsquo;re saying something stupid; and two, there\u0026rsquo;s never a good reason to gender a group. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s a group of men. Even if you know for sure that all of those men identify as male and are comfortable being addressed with male pronouns and male collective words.\nThe Guys Jar Because we are a behavior change company that incentivizes change with money, I created the \u0026ldquo;Guys\u0026rdquo; jar.\nInspired by the swear jar (which, if we\u0026rsquo;re being honest, I could also benefit from), I\u0026rsquo;m putting a dollar into the jar for each time I used a gendered collective word. Every time I say \u0026ldquo;guys,\u0026rdquo; $1. \u0026ldquo;Dudes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bros?\u0026rdquo; $1. \u0026ldquo;Kind and gentle sirs,\u0026rdquo; $1 and a trip back to the present day.\nThere is a lot of excellent writing about why we should address groups of people without being exclusionary or gendered and I won\u0026rsquo;t repeat it here.\nThe one thing that I\u0026rsquo;m still struggling with is that after I exorcise \u0026lsquo;guys\u0026rsquo; from my vocabulary, something else has to take its place.\nTo my ear, \u0026ldquo;folks\u0026rdquo; feels anachronistic, \u0026ldquo;everyone\u0026rdquo; feels robotic and \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; feels false and saccharine.\nWe are, in all seriousness, going back and forth about whether or not \u0026ldquo;homies\u0026rdquo; is gendered or bogged down with other issues.

I started thinking about what makes a good dev blog, and began writing up recommendations for what I thought the team should do. I got all the way through these and realized that I could have gone into nearly any startup and given this same advice. So, here is some advice on how to run your startup\u0026rsquo;s developer blog.\nMission Statement Most likely, your startup\u0026rsquo;s dev blog has primarily been used as a tool for recruitment, and while that\u0026rsquo;s certainly still an objective, you\u0026rsquo;ll fare better if it isn\u0026rsquo;t the main focus. At it\u0026rsquo;s core, a developer blog should be written for developers and by developers about everything that goes into making and supporting a your infrastructure. A developer blog should be a blog that\u0026rsquo;s useful to developers. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Pretty simple.\nAs a recruitment platform, you need to demonstrate that you are a team worth joining. In order to demonstrate that you are a team worth joining, you need to look at what your goals are - both as a company and as an engineering department. What kind of people are you trying to attract? What kind of message are you trying to send? The company I\u0026rsquo;m at doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have those written up yet, but I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t think it matters. The standard answers to those questions are \u0026ldquo;smart, hardworking people.\u0026rdquo;\nAre you a team worth joining? What kinds of teams to developers want to join? With no scientific evidence and only a brief google search, but with 16 years as a working developer, I\u0026rsquo;m going to guess that most developers will say they want two things: 1) to work on cool shit with 2) people they enjoy being around. Often developers will add that they also want to work at a company that values and supports their development team.\nYou need to demonstrate that you have the company culture that supports developers. That you are a self-reflective team that is able to process your failures and adjust accordingly. That you are willing to work to deliver a quality product without burning out developers in the process.\nAnd while we\u0026rsquo;re talking about culture\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s tempting to use your developer blog as a way to show people how \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; it is to work at your startup. You have beer fridge and happy hours and cases of champagne scattered around the office after a company meeting. You need to separate development from drinking culture. Good developers may not drink, but even if they do, they may not have an interest in drinking with their coworkers. Shanley has an excellent write up of what your culture is really saying. Go read it. (This is also a good write up about drinking and exclusion in tech.)\nThe reality is that while you\u0026rsquo;re struggling to build something cool you spend a lot of time figuring out just how not to drown. Sometimes you survive by drinking beers while you\u0026rsquo;re doing a 3am push. It\u0026rsquo;s fine that it happens, but it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a common occurrence and most certainly should not be how you portray your team on your developer blog.\nBut How?! It\u0026rsquo;s actually quite simple.\nFind things you can blog about\nYour team can probably come up with a bunch of things they can blog about. Your company/brand may have some things they don\u0026rsquo;t want discussed. You may have ideas about topics you\u0026rsquo;d like to investigate. Go forth and find ideas. If this is where you\u0026rsquo;re stuck, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any other help for you just yet. Put blog stories into your work tracker Pivotal Tracker, JIRA, ScrumSomethingSomething - whatever you use, make writing blog posts a point-worthy task that\u0026rsquo;s accomplished in a sprint just like any other. Publish\nAnd rejoice when you get to share things you\u0026rsquo;re learning and get feedback on things that you\u0026rsquo;re still uncovering. What\u0026rsquo;s in it for me?! You will benefit because doing this you will:\nthink critically about your work raise your public profile increase your open source contributions And the most self-serving reason of all: it will make you a better developer. If you\u0026rsquo;re not a developer and don\u0026rsquo;t care about any of those things, probably stop reading because I can\u0026rsquo;t help you just yet.\nThe reality is that much of the work you do is probably fairly standard development, so focus on the things that do make you unique - the approaches you take to solving problems, the things you do that don\u0026rsquo;t work, and the ways that you interact with your product and your process.\nI believe that sharing your path as a technology team supporting a growing startup will contribute value to the broader \u0026ldquo;development blog\u0026rdquo; landscape and you\u0026rsquo;ll as demonstrate that you are a team that good developers want to join.\nA Sustainable \u0026lsquo;Healthy Blog\u0026rsquo; plan Get each developer to write a blog about something they\u0026rsquo;re working on individually.\nThis can be difficult because not every developer goes home and hacks on things. The assumption that they do can be exclusionary (often people who don\u0026rsquo;t immediately fit into the \u0026ldquo;brogrammer\u0026rdquo; culture are excluded from this - people have family obligations that prevent them from leaving a job coding all day to go home and code all night). If they don\u0026rsquo;t work on side projects, encourage them to blog about something they\u0026rsquo;re learning at work.\nIf they\u0026rsquo;re not learning anything at work, you have bigger problems than stale content on your developer blog.\nEach time there\u0026rsquo;s a sprint retrospective or project post-mortem, ask: \u0026ldquo;can you blog about this?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not sure, here are some more questions you can ask:\nDid you try something new that worked? Did you try something new that didn\u0026rsquo;t work? Did you stop doing something good or start doing something bad? Did a team member take an action that impacted the rest of the team? Did a major technology fail us? Why? Did something completely unexpected happen that threw us off course? Did you systematically deny a truth that would have made this project better? Did you under- or over-estimate? If you don\u0026rsquo;t answer yes to at least a few of those questions, you may have a development team full of automatons. Out of retrospectives and post-mortems come valuable insights about breakdown in process, changes that will improve workflow, and problems caused by technical short-sightedness. Give your developers a task to write up an overview or deep-dive of this for the blog. If it ends up filled with too much proprietary or otherwise private information, you\u0026rsquo;ve still won as a team because everyone can read it, and you\u0026rsquo;ve given a developer practice in distilling, organizing and presenting information. At worst, you\u0026rsquo;ve helped your developer grow. At best, you\u0026rsquo;ve done that and benefited your blog.\nKeep a bucket list of possible blog topics.\nNew technology, hackathons, nuanced challenges, that list of steps from above - the more you start thinking \u0026ldquo;Can I write a blog about this?\u0026rdquo; the more you\u0026rsquo;ll find things to blog about, I promise.\nYes, but\u0026hellip; Yes, there is always \u0026ldquo;money\u0026rdquo; work to do. There are always projects that need attention. There is always technical debt that you could be paying off. Is having an active dev blog a worthwhile use of the business\u0026rsquo;s time? It is. Go back and re-read the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s in it for me section.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s going to be nearly impossible for developers not to benefit from involvement in this process. I read somewhere that developers can have three years of experience, or can have the same year three times. This is one way you can guarantee that your developers are growing.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling altruistic, think about how you\u0026rsquo;re joining in a community of practice that\u0026rsquo;s larger than your functional or project team and that is going to enrich everyone\u0026rsquo;s experience.\ntl;dr: If you want to recruit good engineers, don\u0026rsquo;t (just) post pictures of mimosas on your developer blog.\nDid I miss anything?

Naturally, I’ve been thinking about what makes a good team in general, and a good software development team specifically. For most of my career, I’ve been part of development teams at development shops or technical companies. Those places already had forward-thinking technical people making infrastructure decisions and crafting the technical culture (for better or worse). By the time I came along, most of the kinks had been worked out.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t work at a technical company right now - I work at an advertising agency.\nThe more time I spend here, the more I realize: advertising agencies are the exact opposite of technical companies. They’re filled with forward-thinking non-technical people. Most agencies used to be print/media focused. But, times change and agencies change along with them. Now most advertising agencies have in-house development teams. A lot of these agencies brand themselves as bleeding-edge and interactive-focused. But those same people who have brilliant creative visions for agencies are rarely able to nurture a technical department. Developers at ad agencies often become after-thoughts. After the brief is done, a producer will get a developer involved to \u0026ldquo;execute the vision.\u0026rdquo; By that time, it\u0026rsquo;s often too late to correct flaws in the design, or point out potential architectural pitfalls.\nAnd sometimes, developers and designers intuitively know that the way they\u0026rsquo;re working isn\u0026rsquo;t right, but can\u0026rsquo;t identify exactly what the problem is or how to fix it. If you find yourself in a similar situation, take the quiz!\nAnswer True or False to each of the following statements:\nMy entire department uses the same version control system, wiki, and ticketing system. I\u0026rsquo;m a developer starting a new project. I know where to go to create my repository, tickets and anything else I need. I\u0026rsquo;m a developer looking for comps. I know where the design team keeps their comps for my projects. I also know each time a comp is updated or changed without having to go look. Each time a project is scoped, I, or another developer, am consulted to validate the feasibility of the overall plan. I have regular meetings with my larger, non-tech project leads about the status of the project\u0026rsquo;s different parts. I have regular meetings within my technical department to do code reviews / educational seminars / showing off neat stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to learn from other members on my team. I think I work with amazing programmers. I\u0026rsquo;m a developer looking to improve my skills. I know my managers are going to be excited to help me do so. I have a suggestion about a breakdown in our process. I know my managers are going to be receptive to my ideas. I can approach the design team about a problem and be sure we’ll find a solution that meets both of our needs. If you answered true to most of the statements above, congratulations! There is nothing more to do - rejoice in your awesome team and go build cool stuff!\nIf you answered false to most of the statements above, it\u0026rsquo;s time for an intervention.

This was my first large non-Drupal project in a while and it was fun to get to do something different.\nWhat was initially presented to me as a “quick two-page site” took a month of long hours to finish.\nThe technology:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built in Symfony, backed by MongoDB, and using HTML5 canvas for visualizations.\nWe’re running a ton of Ubuntu web servers behind a load balancer and one MongoDB server all on Amazon EC2. I got to do all of my own devops on this project and it was nice to have complete control of the stack. We deploy with Capistrano (and its multi-stage extension) and files are stored on S3. Integrating with S3 was totally painless using a pre-existing Symfony library. It was an 11th-hour switch due to storage concerns with EBS and it was absolutely the best choice we could have made.\nI was initially concerned about storing huge json files in the db (each record is about 1MB), but it hasn’t been a problem at all. This is a fairly simple application for a database - there won’t ever be race conditions. The record is written only once upon song creation and will only be read thereafter. (A few edge cases notwithstanding). Getting the mongo server \u0026amp; RAID’ed EBS volumes was a lot easier than I expected.\nThe conversion is being done by a REST server that was written in Java, lives in Tomcat, and is built with ant via the the same Capistrano script I use to deploy the site.\nLessons learned:\nAn Amazon EC2 instance instance has to be off to make an image of it. This is one of those things that sounds so obvious, until you forget to shut an instance down before making an AMI and then can’t figure out why you can’t SSH into it.\nThe site itself is fairly small - only two discrete pages and a minimal admin area. It was initially presented to me as “a quick little build.” It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that perhaps some of the best practices that are part of developing large websites wouldn’t be needed on a smaller project. This, of course, is wrong. Best practices exist usually because they’re “best.” Not best “only if your dev team has 15 people on it.” Or best “just when you’ve got plenty of time.”\nHaving a structured build system, using pull requests to get code into master, documenting everything in a place any team member can access - these practices saved us hours even on this “little” website. I only briefly considered sidestepping some of these, but those practices are there to protect me (and the code) from myself as well.\nThe super-smart Yury Tillis was the front-end engineer on the project and is supposed to do a write-up of some of the magic he worked for the visualization.\nCongratulations to the entire LBi US team who worked so hard to get it launched.\nCheck it out at www.tweetsinger.com\n","permalink":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/tweetsinger-dot-com/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe (LBi US, where I’m a developer) just launched TweetSinger.com, a Sony\nMobile campaign site for their new Xperia series phones.

The developer in me would love to over-engineer this with some sort of d.o %2B latitude / Foursquare, but we could just have a Google doc that people add their usernames to as they introduce themselves. This could also help us to target people who repeatedly sign up and don\u0026rsquo;t attend, so we can gain insight as to the reason(s) why. Ask people why they don\u0026rsquo;t come\nExisting members are self-selected, so we know they\u0026rsquo;re already interested in Drupal. How do we get them to participate? Let\u0026rsquo;s ask. Again, we can start by distributing a survey to the community asking them to self-identify and rank their participation. Topics might include:\nWhy aren\u0026rsquo;t they attending? Would a non-male DUG make them feel more included? Do they feel under-represented in DUG leadership? Is it simply a timing issue? (Which I don\u0026rsquo;t buy) Do women just not like meeting and talking about cool stuff? (Not this either) Brainstorm ways to get the under-represented people to attend After the data is collected, we should meet and discuss ways to increase participation. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to pick a time and place to gather and encourage people to come up with actionable ideas to make the group more diverse.\nI fully support all efforts aimed at increasing the NYCDUG membership both in numbers and diversity. But for now, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on cultivating and encouraging the community we already have. As far as I know, this is the only local initiative to promote diverse participation. If you want to get involved, hit me up on twitter (@drnikki), IRC (drnikki) or email me nikki@drnikki.org\n* As of June 7, there are 2074 members of the NYC drupal group. Additionally, there are 263 members on Meetup.com. I\u0026rsquo;d estimate that there is a significant overlap between the two groups, but probably not 100%. Let\u0026rsquo;s be conservative and say that there\u0026rsquo;s a 70% overlap - that\u0026rsquo;s an additional 77 users from Meetup.com. So combining the two groups, there\u0026rsquo;s 2144 people who could potentially attend an event.\n** I use the National Center for Women and Information Technology\u0026rsquo;s numbers. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they\u0026rsquo;re including project managers, and any number of other titles that would be included in the Drupal ecosphere.\n*** This is absolutely not related to any conversations about gender identity/identification and the way it\u0026rsquo;s represented on drupal.org. Not at all. In. No. Way. I realize that there are more options than just male and female. The ultimate goal is to increase the attendance of everyone who is underrepresented, including all gender variants.\n**** mad credit to jhodgon and ashedryden for brainstorming this with me in the drupalchix IRC room.\nNote - In a previously hosted version of this blog, there were comments. I\u0026rsquo;ve captured them below.\nDRUPALCHIX ROCK decibelplaces replied on Wed, 06/13/2012 - 12:35 PERMALINK\nI was in a focus group once where I was the ONLY Drupaler, and the ONLY FOSS dev; and come to think of it there was ONLY one \"girl\" Anyway, I was surprised at this, I think that the Drupal community is more heterogeneous than most IT groups. I tweeted several drupalchix about this post, and you followed up with http://groups.drupal.org/node/237188 I have also been disappointed that nobody from my \"team\" (male or female) on my last 5 consulting projects over the past year has made it to any of the Drupal meetups (except for Oxygen Marvin who came to a Happy Hour). I have been guilty of not coming myself, often busy with work, or other things, but the Drupal meetups are on my radar. Maybe you can blame my absence for this drop in female attendance :P Or maybe Forrest should let his hair grow longer :D I will make an effort to come again, and bring more people; the more the merrier ‡¡‡ OK, I\u0026rsquo;LL RESPOND roseba replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 17:11 PERMALINK\nThere are two tracks to the NYC Drupal meetup. -I'm absolutely new to Drupal and I want to know more -I'm a rock star Developer and I understand command line, hardware configs, and I'm ready to roll with something new (or share Drupal as I know it) There isn't much going on in between. You are just expected to go from newbie to rock-star in a few months. If you don't... well what's wrong with you? It's fun to hang at the Bof and I've heard some very stimulating scenarios there. Much of what goes on there, I can't take away and directly apply to what I do on a daily basis. That isn't always the best use of limited time. I am not a site builder. I maintain, tweak and enhance an already built site which is large and complex. It's hard to relate to people creating new Drupal sites EVERY DAY. I simply don't get that kind of exposure to it that they do, so the learning curve gets steeper just from lack of time spent doing it. I also don't want to spend every waking hour of my finite personal time doing this on my own. I've done some learning on my own, but getting past some of the road blocks where I have spent hours, even a full day trying to do some simple thing and someone says, \"well look at the documentation\". Or \"google is your friend\". Does one think I haven't done that? And fwiw, when I hear, go to the documentation... and I read the documentation, my first thought is, IS THIS IN ENGLISH? Shouldn't it be understandable to anyone with a minimum amount of tech knowledge? So it comes to time. I work full time. My job is quite demanding. I work in Drupal all day, but it isn't building sites, but maintaining, break fixing and enhancing what we already have. The job is quite complex, and diversified (not just Drupal but other facets of the web too.) In fact, if I had to tell someone what I do all day... I would say, I have no idea. But I'm very busy doing it every day and have very little down town to \"practice\" Drupal. When I get out of work, I'm a single mother with a young kid, a rich personal life. I learned from experience in another field that all work and no play makes Jill a dull and unhappy girl. So with only one night free a week, going to a Drupal meetup, given what the other women have described (all true) is not always the top of my list. I won't say never. I do enjoy the meetups. But there are a lot of other things pulling on my limited free time. My first few Drupal meetups that I attended were very difficult. I felt intimidated. I feel that way every time I go into one, not just because of gender, but because of skill set. Every single female that has contributed to this thread thus far had said something that I would agree with. WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING roseba replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 19:20\nI know that there is some fighting about the two conferences happening this summer. That is a fight that I don't wish to involve myself in. However, I would like to voice something about the whole zest for Unconferences. I attended my first unconference at Poly just a little a year ago. I was very new to the community and extremely grateful for the opportunity to attend. I don't think I had attended any of the meetups yet. Of course there were many proposals of what subjects could present themselves at the Unconference. Many of what I thought could be there, didn't actually come to fruition because the plan was to decide based on those people actually in attendance. As a newbie, I wasn't even sure WHAT to ask for in terms of what I needed, and of course there needed to be someone in the community in attendance available to do it as well. (Just how does someone prepare for something if they don't know they are going to be a presenter, and as a presenter I certainly wouldn't want to waste my time preparing something \"just in case\" either. I don't think this is a formula for a good presentation and it robs the audience in attendance of an opportunity to learn something that they could have learned had the presenter had some time to pull something concrete together.) Anyway, the agenda was chosen for the day and from my point of view, there were some time slots where there really was NOTHING of applicable value for me. Interesting to some degree. Over my head in many cases. There were only a few presentations that I could readily relate to through the entire day, and two of them were during the same time slot which means I could only attend one. Some of the other time slots I was tossing a coin in my head as to which would be the least technical so I could get some value from it. So after allocating 6-7 hours away from my family time to do this (and missing my daughter's ballet recital), I stuck it out with a good faith effort to learn whatever I can in spite of the impossible situation. In the future, I don't want to ever attend another UnConference. My free time on weekends in particular is far to valuable to me to attend something that free wheeling, and if it is, it's for personal fulfillment or simply fun. WE DO SHOW UP! lisa rex replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 11:18\nWhile I'm not a 'regular' at any of the NYC events, I've attended the meetup often enough and have done lightning talks at many of them. I prefer the Drupal happy hour event even more. Sometimes there's very few women, sometimes there a bunch (maybe 10%!). The reason I wasn't there at the last meetup is I was out of town. I have proof we show up. :) This was taken on May 3rd. It wasn't even every woman at the meetup either: http://instagr.am/p/KJQSOKnVEE/ For me personally, most of the talks at the meetup are very dev-centric and I'm not a dev, so I do what I would do at any event: I go hang with RobbietheGeek and the newbies. I take the time to ask them about their Drupal experience so far, sometimes I do usability studies, etc. Is it good use of my time? Sometimes. I am curious why there aren't more women there too. Truthfully, I'm guessing a lot of just a lot going on in our lives and the Drupal meetup isn't high priority. WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO NYC, I nikkiana replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 13:15\nWhen I first moved to NYC, I was a lot more regular about attending both the regular meetup and the happy hour. My main motivation was for social reasons. When I first moved here, everyone I knew in the city was somehow involved with Drupal. It was a good space for me to make friends, plus it was easy to be motivated to go when I was surrounded by coworkers who were also going. I never much cared for the regular meetup, to be honest. I have the attention span of a gnat on crack, so sitting and listening to a lecture irregardless of whether or not the talk was going to be of interest to me (and generally the answer to that was no) is not my idea of a fun and relaxing evening. I'm also not a very patient teacher so sitting and helping the newbies isn't exactly my cup of tea either. I was pretty much going because I felt some sense of community obligation to be there... in part driven by the fact that I'm female and the ladies ought to represent... and the fact that there was the opportunity to go out for beers with friends afterwards. I stopped going when I started re-evaluating how I spent my time and cut out things that I didn't enjoy doing. Pretty much the only thing that can lure me out to a regular meetup is someone from out of town messaging me and asking me to come with them, and even then I'm probably going to tell them that I'll meet up for beers afterwards. Life's too short to be bored. I've always enjoyed the Happy Hour meetups more because I'm a social person. I attend it far less than I used to, though. I only come every couple of months. There are a couple reasons for this... One, financial. I made some choices to pursue artistic endeavors over the past year which has meant working less and money has been much tighter. I've largely stopped going out to eat and drinking at bars. Two, I'm making an effort not to drink to excess and Happy Hour was one of the events in my life where I was more likely to backslide into doing that. If I were to sum all of it up... I'd say this... I don't go out to the Drupal events much anymore because Drupal is less of a priority in my life than it once was. HEY THERE! Sean Robertson replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 13:55\nLong time no see, stranger. ;-) I haven't been to the meetups yet myself because I've generally been busy with other stuff, but I am planning to attend the happy hour on the 27th. MY NAME IS LIZA LizaK replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 15:06 PERMALINK\nMy name is Liza, I've been a member of the Drupal community for more than six years, I've done a lot of work on growing the business of Drupal, spoken at many DrupalCons, and for many years, I used to run Lullabot. (http://drupal.org/user/59115) I do not attend the NYC Drupal events. The first one I went to, with Webchick, we took the train up from Providence where we were giving a workshop, walked into the event, and the guy presenting was talking about porn. We walked out. Trip wasted. Years later, once I moved here to NYC, I went to a Drupal happy hour with some guys who worked for me and were regulars. I was making idle chit chat, and I asked the guy next to me what he did. He literally looked me up and down, said, \"Drupal, honey.\" and turned away. A few minutes later, when he realized who I was, he came running back over and wanted to tell me about his ideas \"so I could take them back to someone at Lullabot\". (I was managing partner at the time.) And then a few years ago, Jen Simmons and I tried to organize a DrupalChix NYC event and we had to get the intervention of the DA to get the event posted on the NYC Drupal group page. (The guys running it didn't want to be \"divisive.\") There were threats involved, and we kept the location of the event secret because we were genuinely scared of them interrupting it. Friends - this is ridiculous. And the sexism that *I* have felt in Drupal - specifically here in NYC - is part of the reason that I decided to go follow my happy trails somewhere else. I have no interest in being a trailblazer... in 2012. I would NOT encourage my daughter to go into Open Source (and she grew up going to DrupalCons). I am a working, single mother; an entrepreneur with a rich personal life and people that I mentor - my time and contributions are valued by people. That time, I decided, was best spent outside of Drupal. (Plus, I wanted to go back to working in fashion... not a lot of room for that there. ;-) I love a lot of the people in Drupal, I miss my friends, and I think that the community is mostly good. But for whatever reason, the Drupal community here in NYC does not seem to be able to shake this shit. I was having dinner last night with a close friend who is very successful in technology and has done work in Drupal. She said that she feels like this problem is getting worse in tech in general - that it is palpably worse than it was 20 years ago. And she has never seen it worse than in Drupal. This makes my heart ache. These were my experiences. These were my choices. No one else will have the same experiences, and I am not recommending that anyone else make the same choices. But, maybe it will help the dialogue. More power to anyone that has the energy to try to tackle this endemic problem. Anyone that wants to reach me can find me at lizakindred (at) gmail (dot) com. Cross posting to http://groups.drupal.org/node/237188. MY TWO CENTS amycham replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 16:04\nI go to events when I can. However, I haven't actually built a Drupal site in about a year and a half--I've been in marketing--so I'm never quite sure what to do with myself at meetups. (You think it's lonely being a woman at our meetups, try being in marketing. :D ) Unlike LizaK, though, I've never felt uncomfortable there, aside from awkwardness from not being up on my Drupal geekery. In fact, I've personally had more problems with unwanted/inappropriate attention and attitudes at social media and general business events than I have in Drupal. As with Lisa Rex, happy hours are way easier for me to go to, since the conversation is more casual and it's easier to participate even if you aren't heavy into the tech. However, I've been hanging around the NYC community to some degree for almost five years...I've slowly made friends and now have people I can chit chat with and feel comfortable asking \"dumb\" questions when needed. To walk into this community by yourself, particularly as a female and/or less-technical professional would, I think, be intimidating. Let's face it, the NYC community has a reputation; there are a lot of good, welcoming people, but we have our issues, too. I would also note that there are a lot of groups targeted specifically toward women in tech, and many of us feel compelled to be there--whether because we want to not feel like a small minority, or we are actively working to support and attract other women to the field, or we just know other people at the events. There are only so many events we can fit into our schedules, which means going to one event may mean skipping another. If I have one night a week I can go to something, do I go to DUG, Webgrrls, Girls in Tech, Women in Communications,a photo meetup, a social media meetup, or...? I don't know what the solution is, though there are pieces we can work with. Data integrity is fairly easy...if each meetup has someone committed to noting who attends, that can readily be compared to signups on GDO. Also, I'll be contacting organizers of other meetups/groups in my camp promotions, in hopes of drawing some registrations from other related tech groups and, yes, a couple female-oriented tech groups. A similar tactic could be used in collecting survey data. A couple press releases, a bribe (eg, enter drawing for a gift card), some direct marketing and a little patience should be able to generate a useful data pool. (I did a bunch of this in b-school and would be happy to help.) It's a sticky problem a lot of people are trying to figure out. As someone who was at one time the only girl in certain Java and game development classes, the only female developer in a company, and more recently the only marketing person in the room, I can attest that getting past the \"only-ness\" requires having a clear, compelling reason for being there. It's way easier to go someplace where you blend in. (I think that got kind of ramble-y, but hopefully it makes sense.) I\u0026rsquo;m amycham everywhere, including D.O., Gmail and Twitter.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, PLEASE KEEP \u0026lsquo;EM COMING! nikki replied on Thu, 06/14/2012 - 18:10\nAlso, If you're concerned about posting publicly or backlash from responding, you can email them to nycdiversity@drnikki.org.

DRUPALCHIX AND MEETUPS techgirlgeek replied on Mon, 06/18/2012 - 15:53\nHi - My name is Karyn or, as I'm known in the Drupal Community, techgirlgeek. I feel very lucky that I live in the Denver/Boulder area, and feel very welcome, and accepted in the Drupal Community, especially in our local community. Since last summer I've been trying to get a DrupalChix centered meetup going in our community, alternating between Boulder and Denver each month. I've also, TG, never been the subject of such nastiness as LizaK had to endure. People never cease to amaze me. I have to say I have received a ton of encouragement from our local community, both men and women alike, to do these meetups. I have even had some prominent members respond in defense of the DrupalChix meetups to some not-so-kind posts against them continuing. I'm working hard to continue and grow these meetups, however, the attendance numbers are not increasing, quite the contrary. I have some regular attendees, and we've even switched the focus from presentations (since I was running out of steam presenting every month) to adopting the Drupal Ladder, but overall they are not growing in attendance. One thing that I did find was that even the perception of some of the women attending the meetups was that it was a beginners meetup and that \"very technical\" discussions wouldn't/couldn't happen there. I gave at least one drush talk, and not just how to download new modules. These statements were from other women, and not necessarily high level devs either. One gal is very new to drupal, and admits that she \"can't theme, and can't write code\". So, if women themselves refuse to see women as being technical, I'm not sure how we are supposed to convince the rest of the community. So, as Lisa Rex said, I think the women in our community are just so busy, meetups are not the priority. I will say that at some of our \"general meetups\" I have seen and heard that we are starting to see more women in attendance, going from about 3% to 10% of the attendance totals. Oh, Liza Emma replied on Mon, 06/18/2012 - 16:20\nOh Liza - your post broke my heart. I found the hack jam at DrupalCON Denver was a humiliating experience (trying to participate in groups of men who would not be engaged to include myself or another woman in the coding portion . We were assigned theme work ( I am a senior developer and suck at design , but that's all I was offered) . We both ended up leaving early to attend the sponsor fair). I would love to go to meetups, but I have a family and I just can't make it downtown (meetups in our town tend to be in pubs in the evening). I wonder how many women can be isolated in this way? I would love to do a Google hangout with drupalchix or something online that really connects us all without needing to physically be somewhere. I know in-person is ideal, but just my two cents. I think sometimes the moms go missing :) I tried to write about it here: http://tiptoes.ca/?p=231 REMOTE MEETUPS strangers replied on Tue, 06/19/2012 - 18:01\nI do try and have remote opportunities for my meetups, and Google Hangout is fun, but maxes out at 10 people.
