I have several active or otherwise on-going open source projects.  I'm also currently doing some thinking about university open source project offices.  [More about OSPOs...](/posts/ospos)

## Open Demographics
The [Open Demographics](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics) project is an open-source project designed to help people and teams ask questions about demographic data (gender, sexual orientation, race).  It uses an open source paradigm (community sourced, publicly accessible) to generate a collective consensus on the most inclusive ways to ask questions.  This project is not without it's own political shortcomings and challenges - it's in English, and most contributors are based in the United States.  The community is working to enhance it and expand it to other regions.

Outcomes: This project, in concert with the <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/gender">Gender Field</a> project on Drupal.org has resulted in more inclusive questioning for over _one million_ Drupal.org users.  Check out the <a href="https://dri.es/offering-more-inclusive-user-demographic-forms">blog announcement</a> by Dries Buytaert (founder of Drupal).



## Trans-inclusive data model

As the result of both Open Demographics conversations, and other conversations about how to store data collected by inclusive demographic forms.  The trans-inclusive data model (currently under construction) is designed to store name, gender, pronoun information in a context-sensitive way that supports asking questions of the data like "I'm about to call this person at home - what is their name and pronoun there?"

You can read more about this data model in [Chapter 4 of my dissertation]({{< static url="Stevens_Dissertation.pdf" >}})


## Open Government Vermont

When I moved back to Vermont in 2022 (initially to work for Dartmouth, but now I live here forever!), I immediately got involved in local town issues. I am continually reminded of how little I know about making communities better _in slow, steady practice_. In contrast to the theory of my PhD, and the radical protest of my younger days, my current work is more complicated, more intricate, and far slower than I was prepared for. As I learn and experience the details of how local government and small-town social change works, I'm sharing it [here](/series/open-gov-vermont/). 

_Note:_ As of this writing (August 2023), I am an elected member of our town Selectboard and also the (Interim) Town Health Officer.


## Open Source PhD

Before I began my PhD program, I frequently thought, “I wish I knew what people in [insert name of PhD program] were reading” because I wanted to do that same reading. Some courses had syllabi available, some had notes, but it was hard to get a sense of the themes that were being discussed. I told myself that if I were ever lucky enough to be able enter a PhD program, I’d share as much as I could about the material I was reading.  During my coursework and comprehensive exams, I did just that.  Those posts form the core of the Open Source PhD project.  [Read all of the posts](/series/open-source-phd/).
