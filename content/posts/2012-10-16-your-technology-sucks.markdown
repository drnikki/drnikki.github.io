I recently got an email from an organization looking for a Senior Engineer to work on their project.  
<!-- more -->

I responded:

> Hi there,
>
> Thanks for reaching out. Can you tell me a little more about the technology you're using and the make up of your team?
>
> Thanks,

> Nikki


A few minutes later, I received their response:

> Hi Nikki,

REALLY? SEEEERIOUSLY? You're going to appease a developer by sending some elevator pitch buzzwords about best practices and software ecosystems? I responded with a polite thanks-but-no-thanks, but now I have the perfect pile of bullshit to give to any startup looking to completely obfuscate their technology stack.  This is for you blogr.io, gab.le, snap.zi, chatd.og or whatever silly web 2.95 names are coming next.
