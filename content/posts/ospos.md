The information below is part of a larger conversation about Open Source Program (or Project) Offices (OSPOs)in academic (university) settings.  


*Further Reading* I made a public and continually updated [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5062427/ospos/library) with references I've found useful in my thinking both about open source, and about OSPOs in particular. 

*Other Organizations* 
- [TODO group](https://todogroup.org): an open collective of OSPOs, largely corporate.  TODO is founded with/by the Linux Foundation 
    - See, in particular, their [overview presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4dhx0Dg8fZDO8yzp7nWC2r5WHyVH-jjSQM59lkKLdo/edit#slide=id.g196bab9accf_1_1268) about TODO and OSPOs in general. 
- [OSPO++](https://ospoplusplus.org/): A group of OSPOs specifically in academic or government contexts.
