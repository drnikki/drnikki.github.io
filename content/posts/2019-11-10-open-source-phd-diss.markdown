Since my first semester in graduate school, I've been posting my reading lists and general themes for the month.  Since my comprehensive exams in May, I have certainly been reading, though not nearly as much.  I took some time off, moved to the Dartmouth area and began working as a researcher and lab manager of the Digital Justice Lab, a lab in the <a href="http://dhse.dartmouth.edu">Digital Humanities and Social Engagement</a> Cluster.  

Part of the motivation of sharing those lists (you can see the first entry <a href="http://nikkistevens.com/open-source-phd-june-2017">here</a>) was to acknowledge my privilege to be able to read and think with professors and peers, and to share as much as I can about the process. My years of open-source training have instilled in me that the more knowledge can be shared, the better.  I've struggled with the best way to maintain that as I enter the dissertation phase of my degree.  The best conclusion I've come to is that I can share how I'm working, I can share some of the artifacts of the process, and I can share - for better and/or worse - how I'm going to get this dissertation done in the next 18 months.  

So, welcome to "Open Source Dissertation."

I'm breaking the next few weeks into theme weeks so that I can survey the literature in several key areas and get a sense of key texts I'll need to engage with.  This week is "Conceptual Modeling."
