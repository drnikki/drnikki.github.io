On why diversity work is problematic.

Rather than compose a list of things that were wrong, what I can do is ahre a list of questions that I don't have the answers to, and that, over time, drove me to leave an active role in DD&I.

<b>How can we know if an action or campaign was effective?</b> Even the framing of this question is problematic, but regardless of how one tweaks it, who gets to say what worked and how do we get their evaluations of it?

<b>For whom are we doing this work</b>  And are we doing this work _for_ or _with?_  Who gets to make that distinction?

<b>Can I honestly recommend the community?</b>

<b>Am I seeing active involvement from those in power?</b>

<b>Are there clear paths forward?</b>

<b>For whose liberation am I working?</b>

<b>Is this work designed to make white women feel better?</b>

<b>Why are most of the people doing this work women?</b>

<b>By doing this work, am I complicit in things I don't want to be?</b> Does doing this work reinforce white supremacy?  I had always conceptualized my task as one to address white people specifically.


While there is academic research that "answers" some of these questions, or that positions D&I work as deeply, eternally problematic,  or effective and crucial, at the end of it all, I was just conflicted.  

My work and preoccupation with racial injustice in the US continues, and I'm still invested in the ways in which I can, in my work, combat oppressive systems.  

I told myself that it made a difference.  That I was working to normalize being verbal and calling out white bullshit.
