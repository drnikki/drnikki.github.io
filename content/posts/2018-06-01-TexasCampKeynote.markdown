Today, I was honored to give the opening keynote at <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/">TexasCamp</a>.  The organizing team has done such a good job with this camp that the logistics have become invisible.  

Below is the video of my talk:

[Kevin Thull](https://twitter.com/kevinjthull) is a super Drupal hero for getting video of this up and for magically making my dog the thumbnail of the video.  Thanks, Kevin!
