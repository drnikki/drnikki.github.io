At the end of July, I was appointed Bradford, Vermont's Interim Town Health Officer (THO), after the resignation of our previous officer.   This is a new role for me, so I reached out to VLCT for information on what THO do.  Here's what I found out

- The state of Vermont has [information and trainings](https://www.healthvermont.gov/environment/town-health-officers). 
- On that site, you can download [the Town Health Officer Manual]({{< static url="static/Env_THO_THOManual.pdf" >}})
- Vermont made [a slide presentation]({{< static url="Env_THOPresentationDuties_100112.pdf" >}}) of THO duties
