There have been a lot of questions lately about who gets to speak (and otherwise participate) in SelectBoard meetings.  Here's what I know:

- The Selectboard is governed by Vermont's [Open Meeting Law](https://www.vlct.org/topics/vermonts-open-meeting-law) ([The specific statute - **1 V.S.A. ยง 312**](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/005/00312#:~:text=Subchapter%20002%20%3A%20Public%20Information%20%28Cite%20as%3A%201,as%20provided%20in%20section%20313%20of%20this%20title.))  
- VLCT offers FAQs about the Open Meeting Law.  These might be locked behind their login screen, so [here is a PDF of that page]({{< static url="VLCTOpenMeetingLawFAQs.pdf" >}})
- VLCT offers [Model Rules of Procedure](https://www.vlct.org/resource/model-rules-procedure-municipal-boards) for SelectBoards without their own bylaws
- In conversation with VLCT, they note that the spirit of the law is to err on the side of allowing more participation than less, within "reasonable" limits.
