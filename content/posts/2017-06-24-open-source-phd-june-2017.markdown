I have often thought, "I wish I knew what people in [insert name of PhD program] were reading." because I wanted to do that same reading. Some courses had syllabi available, some had notes, but it was hard to get a sense of the themes that were being discussed.  I told myself that if I were ever lucky enough to be able enter a PhD program, I'd share as much as I could about the material I was reading.

Here we are.

I spent June thinking primarily about engineering ethics:
- is software engineering part of engineering proper? (the articles say no)
- is software engineering a "profession" like civil engineering? (again, no)
- what would a code of ethics for software engineers look like (these exist)
    - BUT what would the code look like _if it were written with marginalized engineers as the focus?_ I've been calling this intersectional engineering ethics and I'm still thinking about it.
    - in order to center the experiences and needs of marginalized/underrepresented engineers, do you need to start with different theories and questions?

One of the things I love most about working hard is tracking how hard I'm working.  Total number of pages (articles and books only) read this month: **728**
