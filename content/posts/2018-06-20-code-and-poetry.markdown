[TODO: insert critical code tweet]

do people who think architecture is beautiful and organic and poetic and magical spend time as bricklayers and masons?

(in this analogy?metaphor?) the buildings are the software. (so are the bricks the code)

History
- CCS in Jan?
- - struggling to interact with people who are reading code as text divorced from its technical context.  
- Like margaret hamilton's code -how can we read into her choice and artifact without understanding the context

Code has a poetic structure > Code CAN have a poetic structure

Because i would say it doesn't.

It is utiltariand and in most cases, beauty is accidental.
order, elegance is intentional.  

Poetry, though?
As someone who has been writing code since 1997, I'm grumpy about it.  

Fighting my own "get off my lawn instincts."  I'm not saying that the ony peple who have been coding for X years should be commenting, and i'm not gatekeeping based on skill level.  But this feels like romanticizing the process (as a strange counterpoint to all of the deominzing code as a source of bias)
or a weird parallel because surely poetry is biased and subjective.

And I wonder how much easier it is to remoanticize something when you have not spent 12 hour days fighting with it?  

Code CAn be beautiful.  code is often craft and the result of years of work by a crafts person.  But just as often it is compied form a STack Overflow post and psted into an editor in the hope to just get something working.  

the copy pasta assembly is poetry too?  If we must compare it to something, a collage seems more appropriate.

Am I reflected in the code I write?  Sometimes.  Some thiengs are just "how it's done."  This code that I wrote could have been written by anyone with familiarity with the best practices for how to do something.

Recent architecture conversation with Sean.  He'd devised a way.  I've found some sticky parts and suggested a different approach.  am _i_ reflected in that?

where does the code stop and architecture and assembly begin?

More beutiy in these elegent solution than in the wiring I"ll have to do to support them


Where in the conversation re people who say that code is NOT poetry?

(I'm an engineer, I had to look up what people mean by poetic structure)

[TODO: insert link to JW's blog - is it code if it does not run]
What's the POINT?


What do I want?  
- people to locate themseles as speakers.  I"m going ot hear you differently if you're not a coder.
- no universalizing language - about code as poetry, craft or beauty
- acknowledgement of code as a capitalist tool as much as anything else
- related to site of bias and dangerousacknowledge as propaganda (get off my lawn)

but also, code has agency.
