title: "Is my internet back yet?"

One of my favorite things about being a programmer is that I can figure out ways to solve little problems.  Little non-problems, even.  Over the last week, there have been Time Warner internet outages in my neighborhood.

So I built a busted little script will send me a TEXT MESSAGE when my internet has come back on (I love you, Twilio).  I've just saved you about 4 minutes writing your own.
