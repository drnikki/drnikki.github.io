(October 12, 2017)
What follows is my thesis from the University of Hawai`i.  It's included here for anyone interested in grassroots activist organizing and its impact on the participants.  

Reading this over, it feels like I wrote it 20 years and 100 books ago, and I'm thankful that my opinions and insight have evolved (for better or worse) since I wrote this.  I believe that it's important to practice openness wherever possible, and am publishing this in that spirit.
