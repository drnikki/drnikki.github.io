"We have created a system which makes collaborative work look like individual achievement."

What we may find is a pattern or network of who gets credit from whom?  In other words, do people most often give credit to those who are demographically similar to them?

The web of contributors expanding to resemble how much work all of this is.

Resist the urge to add a category for "how contributed."  This will make sharing contributions more laborious
- will be wanted tby coders who desire to sit above others who played a part.

What is lost by doing this in a flat way?
- the false (and arbitrary and NOT objective) division between tech and non-Tech
- or worse/more dangerous between code and community
- Has gender and its false binary taught us nothing?

We love to say you either write code or you don't and if you don't go here and X.  

But here are many ways to getting code written besides being the one who typed it up.

What do we (as people who write the code) lose by acknowleding that? and it's not nothing, because if it were, we wouldn't fight so hard against it.

It sure makes us seem meretorious, as if we were out here doing things alone or without a lot of help.
