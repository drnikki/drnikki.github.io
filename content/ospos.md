The information below is part of a larger conversation about Open Source Program (or Project) Offices (OSPOs)in academic (university) settings.  


<!-- NEXT TASK:
https://ospoplusplus.org/resource/

take these, and grab the objectives and put them into a table or sheet or something so that they can be compared across each other. -->


### Ways to Contribute
[VERSO] has compiled a list of [ways to contribute](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/start-contributing/) to open source, especially if you are not a coder.

### What other universities/companies/municipalities have OSPOs?
- OSPO++'s [list of member organizations(https://ospoplusplus.org/about/members/)] 
- The interactive [OSPO Landscape Map](https://landscape.todogroup.org/card-mode?category=ospo-adopter&grouping=category) is a map of open source program offices, supporters, and associates. 

### Open Source by the numbers

### Case Studies
- [TODO Group has a list](https://todogroup.org/guides/#ospo-case-studies)
- Open@RIT [OSPO++](https://ospoplusplus.org/resource/open-rit/),  [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/rit/)


### Groups supporting OSPOS
- [TODO group](https://todogroup.org): an open collective of OSPOs, largely corporate.  TODO is founded with/by the Linux Foundation 
    - See, in particular, their [overview presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4dhx0Dg8fZDO8yzp7nWC2r5WHyVH-jjSQM59lkKLdo/edit#slide=id.g196bab9accf_1_1268) about TODO and OSPOs in general. 
- [OSPO++](https://ospoplusplus.org/): A group of OSPOs specifically in academic or government contexts. 
- The [OSPOlogy project](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology) (part of TODO Group) is the active community/participation arm of TODO focused on the study of OSPOs.

### Further Reading
I made a public and continually updated [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5062427/ospos/library) with references I've found useful in my thinking both about open source, and about OSPOs in particular.

[VERSO](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/), the OSPO at University of Vermont, has compiled a [reading list](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/reading-list/). 

Open@RIT has a [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2725709/rit_open_work_resources/library) of resources about open work. [source](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/rit/)
