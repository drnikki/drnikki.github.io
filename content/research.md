My research agenda examines how software engineering practices are situated within contemporary political and social systems of power.  This takes two main forms: First, while we might frequently hear accusations of tech being racist or transphobic, we don't often see the technical causes of those outcomes; my research uncovers those causes -- when we know _how_ we are making [bad thing], then we may have an opportunity to do things differently.  Second, I research how open source communities enact the _community_ part of their name. My work seeks to answer questions like: 
- How do we collect demographic data about community members, and what do we do with that data once we have it?
- What actions and processes contribute to a open source community where systemically minoritized members feel safe(r) and welcome? 
- How can we identify and offset the problematic roots of open source to make contribution accessible to more people? 


## Uncovering the technical causes of technical injustice
In order to unearth tehnical roots of injustice, I use several approaches, which I broadly consider to be three kinds of engineering:

Frequently, I perform what I call _historical engineering:_ I use close reading, archival analysis, and software design to excavate software engineering practices with the aim of historicizing and denaturalizing them. Using this method, I have reviewed texts from early data modelers, like E.F. Codd and Peter P.Y. Chen. I also recreate technology and practices identified in early patent documents to identify the moments in which problematic epistemologies were codified.*

I very often use _reverse engineering_ to hack into existing software applications and examine the choices made by their creators. Most often, I reverse engineer the Android applications of smart home devices to uncover the relational data models within. I analyze in-code annotations, create entity-relationship diagrams, and then examine those resultant models, again linking them back to systems of race and gender power. 
In my work, I have developed a method for performing a reverse engineering investigations within a specific sociotechnical context -- a situated analysis of the contextual epistemological frames embedded within relational paradigms. 

I also use _speculative engineering_ and software engineering to explore the potentiality and creative possibilities of existing and not-yet-created computational tools. In my speculative engineering process, I frequently suggest that the temporality of modern digital computing is incommensurate with the temporality of modern transgender lives. Following this, I design and build a trans-inclusive data model that demonstrates ways to actively subvert systems of racialized and gendered power. 

The most well-developed example of these methods in practice is in my dissertation,  [_Modeling Power: Data Models and the Production of Social Inequality_]({{< static url="Stevens-Dissertation.pdf" >}}).

## Open Source Community Assessment and Culture Change

The roots of this work come from my nearly two decades of involvement in open source communities.  In the Drupal community, I founded the [Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Working Group](https://www.drupaldiversity.com).  With a few others, we grew the group from 5 to 700 over two years, and grappled with ways to make Drupal a safer space for folks from underrepresented groups.  

Out of this work came [Open Demographics](/open-source), a project that uses open source paradigmns to construct demographic questions, following the disability justice paradigm "Nothing About Us Without Us."  I've consulted for Mozilla, Stack Overflow, WordPress on asking demographic questions and then, doing the even tougher work of figuring out what comes next.  

This work is frequently less legible and supportable in academic contexts, where I currently work, and so I'm looking for partners to think with me about lifecycles of community change, and to build out my framework Open DEI - a project which gives communities a culturally-relevant foundation for thinking about their own community health apart from statistically significant metrics.
