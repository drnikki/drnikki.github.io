      <description>Every Friday, my cohort and I attend HSD602, the second half of our year-long seminar on the foundations of STS. Each week, a different student leads class and has about an hour to decide what the class will do and how we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this week&amp;rsquo;s readings.</description>

      <description>As part of a series of posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been calling &amp;ldquo;Open Source PhD,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m posting some of the materials that I prepared as I was studying for my comprehensive exams.</description>

      <description>This month I wrote the proposal for my second year project, and the reading reflects that.
Below is a list of books and articles I read this month. Adey, P. (2009).</description>

      <description>I spent August getting used to being back in class, and thinking about:
how do engineers think about engineering ethics on a day-to-day basis (if at all)? just because we can build something, does that mean we should?</description>

      <description>The semester is finally over! I made it out without too many tears, and I spent the semester break doing some school reading but mostly I read junk and loved it.</description>

      <description>This month I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a very good job of what I&amp;rsquo;d tried to do last month - which is focus on only a few things. I read widely for a few reasons</description>

      <description>This month, I&amp;rsquo;m focused on getting a few big presentations ready, and writing a three large projects. I&amp;rsquo;m trying not to get interested in anything new (which is hard, because there&amp;rsquo;s so many good and interesting things!</description>

      <description>I spent July thinking about open source community health:
how do measures of open source project success interact with measures of community health? (they don&amp;rsquo;t, because no measures of community health exist) what would a &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; open source community look like?</description>

      <description>I have often thought, &amp;ldquo;I wish I knew what people in [insert name of PhD program] were reading.&amp;rdquo; because I wanted to do that same reading. Some courses had syllabi available, some had notes, but it was hard to get a sense of the themes that were being discussed.</description>

      <description>This month, I spoke at TEDxASU. Preparing for that took nearly all of the time I would have normally spent reading. Oops! In my main seminar, we were assigned a few books instead of a slew of articles, so it&amp;rsquo;s a short list.</description>

      <description>November was a shorter school month, and was mostly filled with doing everything I could to get things ready for spring and wrapped up for fall. I did a lot of writing for assignments and projects, and made a conscious effort to not read more than I needed to and to instead work to integrate what I&amp;rsquo;d already read.</description>

      <description>This month marked the LAST SEMESTER OF PHD COURSEWORK for me. I completed another draft of my second year project, a revise and resubmit (accepted!), and got my comprehensive exam reading lists approved.</description>

      <description>I spent October juggling projects (many not my own), and found that I was returning to some fundamental questions that I left unanswered (or didn&amp;rsquo;t answer satisfactorily) at the start of the semester:</description>

      <description>A deadline for a revise and resubmit meant not a lot of other reading got done. Below was reading required for classes.

      <description>I spent September struggling to stay afloat. The way work was structured, I was able to spend time thinking about fewer ideas, but exploring them more fully. This month, those ideas were:</description>

      <description>This summer I wrote my second year project. As I gathered items, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to list them all as &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; since I did a lot of skimming and extracting rather than wholesale reading.</description>

      <description>Since my first semester in graduate school, I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting my reading lists and general themes for the month. Since my comprehensive exams in May, I have certainly been reading, though not nearly as much.</description>
