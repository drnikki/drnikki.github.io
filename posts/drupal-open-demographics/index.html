The current proposal is that the user profile form will have fields at least for gender and “ideally” for other demographic categories (race, sexual orientation, etc)\nAn incomplete history around 2010, there was an issue to expand Drupal’s gender field, which at the time had options for only male or female. This issue is long (154 comments) and notoriously full of vitriol and some of the best and worst of the Drupal community. The resolution was to lock the thread and leave the field as is.\nThat issue spawned (or was filed in parallel) with another issue to include pronouns on a user’s profile. In November 2011, the drupal.org gender field had the following options: male, female, transgender, other.\nThere was a related issue for adding an “about me” field to the profile.
