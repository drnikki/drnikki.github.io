Details (and poster!) below.\nSoftware from the Inside Out: Reverse Engineering as Method\nNikki Stevens, PhD\nTuesday, Sept 24 12:00-1:15pm EST\nIn person: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, DUSP: Building 9, Room 451¬†on zoom: üíª https://mit.zoom.us/j/96238770940\nnotes and references https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEmqYoGV-Egbx8xezwqr7nhzVaV8oNqV2ceU2EwNA2M/edit\nAbstract\nHow would our studies of software change if we could examine the code itself?¬†What new forms of inquiry become available when we reduce the opacity of commercial software products?¬†In this talk, I describe several processes of reverse engineering, a series of methods by which we can look inside software that we did not build.¬†Throughout, I discuss opportunities for inquiry and theorization offered by penetration approaches, as well as some common ethical and legal considerations. I ground the theory with case studies from Android applications, Internet of Things products, and the US criminal legal system. Ultimately, I argue that reverse engineering is a key method for the humanistic and social studies of software and will have implications for scholars and practitioners interested in software‚Äôs role in social change.¬†Bio\nNikki Stevens is a critical technology researcher, software practitioner, and open-source community leader. Their research demonstrates that data infrastructures‚Äîdata models, databases, data structures‚Äîare locations in which software harms can be incubated, exacerbated, or ameliorated. Using mixed methods, including historical analysis, reverse engineering and speculative design, Stevens excavates technical practices, linking them to aspects of contemporary structural oppression. Their first monograph,¬†Abolitionist Engineering¬†(in progress), develops an approach to data structures that orients engineering practice towards alternative futures. In industry, Stevens led the architecture of software products for billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola, Sony, and Instagram, and their work has won numerous awards, including at SXSW, the premier conference for new media. In open source, Stevens‚Äô work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award and recognitions by Red Hat and The Linux Foundation. Their work has been supported by Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft. They are currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT‚Äôs Data + Feminism Lab.\n(Downloadable Poster) üìÑ Downloadable Poster\n","wordCount":"399","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-09-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dr. Nikki Stevens"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/2024-09-20-mit-talk/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dr. Nikki Stevens","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nikkistevens.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/ accesskey=h title="Dr. Nikki Stevens (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nikkistevens.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Dr. Nikki Stevens</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/research/ title=Research><span>Research</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/open-source/ title="Open Source"><span>Open Source</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://nikkistevens.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">MIT Talk: Reverse Engineering as Method</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-09-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 20, 2024</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;399 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Dr. Nikki Stevens</div></header><div class=post-content><p>I&rsquo;m so excited to give a talk at MIT on Tuesday.
