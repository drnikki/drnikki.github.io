I told myself that if I were ever lucky enough to be able enter a PhD program, I’d share as much as I could about the material I was reading.\nHere we are.\nI spent June thinking primarily about engineering ethics:\nis software engineering part of engineering proper? (the articles say no) is software engineering a “profession” like civil engineering? (again, no) what would a code of ethics for software engineers look like (these exist) BUT what would the code look like if it were written with marginalized engineers as the focus? I’ve been calling this intersectional engineering ethics and I’m still thinking about it. in order to center the experiences and needs of marginalized/underrepresented engineers, do you need to start with different theories and questions?
