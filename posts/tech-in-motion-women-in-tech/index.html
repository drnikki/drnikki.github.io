On the eve of the SendGrid/Adria/PyCon debacle, we met to talk about being women in leadership positions, obstacles we’ve overcome, and advice for women who want to be leaders (and the men that are in their lives).\nA quick round up of highlights of the event.\nNot only did Beth Gilfeather sneak me a glass of wine right before the panel started, she gave some really great advice about picking the right partner, staying balanced and rising to the top.\nCEO of Motion Recruitment Partners shares how she ended up in her management seat at #TechInMotion w/ @jobspringnyc twitter.com/E_BAUM/status/…\n— Emily Baumgartner (@E_BAUM) March 21, 2013 Cailin Nelson gave wonderful perspective about the difficulties of working with men vs her physics PhD. My favorite was her thought that being a woman leading men can be an advantage because she doesn’t set off any competitive urges in the men she manages. Definitely a testament to her leadership skills.\nCailin Neldon: Nothing will ever be as terrible as my PhD qualifying exam. Haa I love this panel so much. #fangirling#techinmotion\n— rachelsklar (@rachelsklar) March 22, 2013 Lindsay Bressler shared some of her great experiences about making sure she always had a seat at the table in meetings. But my favorite was when she encouraged women to trust their intution - if you have a good idea or point to make in your head, don’t wait for someone else to say it for you.\nAnna Khan gave some great contrast to how men and women pitch VCs. The moral for women: pitch even if your idea isn’t ready.\nAnna Khan of Bessemer highlights the need for more women on the other side of the table. #vc #techinmotion\n— Cynthia Schames (@CynthiaSchames) March 21, 2013 Carol Mirakove gave thougthful and nuanced advice about managing inappropriate workplace humor, staying informed and reading as much of everything as you can.\nMerrill Ferguson was a force to be reckoned with. She gave spot-on advice about not caring what anyone thinks of you, not being afraid to say what you see going on around you, and about the importance of mentors.\nMerrill Ferguson wishes she had more female mentors/role models above her. Also no longer really cares what ppl think of her.#techinmotion\n— rachelsklar (@rachelsklar) March 21, 2013 Even though my parting advice was to be cocky, I was honored and humbled to be on a panel of such smart and accomplished women.\nWomen: \"Talk a HUGE game.\" #techinmotion #leanin\n— Carlee Jean (@MsCarleeJean) March 22, 2013 Watch your tone Nikki Stevens VP Eng @refinery29 laying it out. Been told \"watch tone; strong personality; step off\" as a woman in tech. #techinmotion\n— Cynthia Schames (@CynthiaSchames) March 21, 2013 After the panel, a man came up to me and asked what he should do when he has a problem with a woman’s tone. I gave him the best advice I could think of, but more than the advice, I loved that he asked.\nIf I missed you or we didn’t connect, I’d love to hear from you.\nHuge thanks to all of the women on the panel: Anna Khan, Carol Mirakove, Beth Gilfeather, Merrill Ferguson, Cailin Nelson, Lindsay Bressler; moderator Mandy Walker; host Sloane Barbour and of course Rachel Sklar, being all over the internet even when she was with us.\nWhat an amazing turn out for #womenintech hosted by #techinmotion #nyc pic.twitter.com/Jy0lNtH9rr\n— Workbridge NY (@WorkbridgeNY) March 21, 2013 ","wordCount":"615","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2013-03-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2013-03-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dr. Nikki Stevens"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nikkistevens.com/posts/tech-in-motion-women-in-tech/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dr. Nikki Stevens","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nikkistevens.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/ accesskey=h title="Dr. Nikki Stevens (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nikkistevens.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Dr. Nikki Stevens</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/research/ title=Research><span>Research</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/open-source/ title="Open Source"><span>Open Source</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://nikkistevens.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://nikkistevens.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Tech In Motion: Women in Tech</h1><div class=post-description>A recap of the Women in Tech panel at the Tech in Motion meetup.</div><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2013-03-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 22, 2013&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;615 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Dr. Nikki Stevens</div></header><div class=post-content><h3 id=no-binders>No binders<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-binders>#</a></h3><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p>They may not be in Binders, but it's a room full of womentechies. <a href=https://twitter.com/search/%23TechInMotion>#TechInMotion</a> <a href=http://t.co/IoD3gEeZto title=http://twitter.com/mmsuperflyjr/status/314880189857423360/photo/1>twitter.com/mmsuperflyjr/s…</a></p>&mdash; Mallory Johns (@mmsuperflyjr) <a href=https://twitter.com/mmsuperflyjr/status/314880189857423360>March 21, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src=//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>Last night at AlleyNYC, I was part of the Women in Tech panel at the Tech in Motion meetup.
