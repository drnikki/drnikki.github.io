## Running the Site
- Make sure that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) is installed.  This repo is set to run on:
```
hugo v0.116.1-3e1ea030a5897addaf9d113d0826709fe07f77c0+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=2023-08-01T07:24:54Z VendorInfo=brew
```

- When you checkout the repo, go and get all of the submodule content: `git submodule update --init`

## Enhancing 
These are here for my own remembering.

Need to change the theme?  You can [sort by number of github stars](https://github.com/lon9/hugo_stars)
